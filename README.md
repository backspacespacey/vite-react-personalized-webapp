## Features

- Fetches random photos from Unsplash using the Unsplash Photo API.  
- Search functionality to query photos by keyword (check comments in main.jsx file to update). 
- Responsive grid layout for displaying photos with captions (check comments in style.css to update).  
- Uses React hooks and functional components.  
- Built with Vite instead of Webpack for faster development and build times.
- Check code/comments to update the search query to your liking or the grid layout such as 3 x 3 or 2 x 2, etc.
